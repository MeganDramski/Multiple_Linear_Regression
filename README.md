# Multiple_Linear_Regression

 Business challenge

The dataset contains information collected from 50 companies. I analyze data and create a model that will tell which type of company is the most profitable. The data is anonymized and it contains 5 columns: 
"	R&D Spend 
"	Administration 
"	Marketing Spend 
"	State 
"	Profit 
Profit is a dependent variable and the rest independent variables. I am creating a model that will help asses which companies are worth of investment to maximize the investors profit.
